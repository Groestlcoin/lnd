; Adding an external IP will advertise your node to the network. This signals

;
; Instead of explicitly stating your external IP address, you can also enable
; UPnP or NAT-PMP support on the daemon. Both techniques will be tried and
; require proper hardware support. In order to detect this hardware support,
; `lnd` uses a dependency that retrieves the router's gateway address by using
; different built-in binaries in each platform. Therefore, it is possible that
; we are unable to detect the hardware and `lnd` will exit with an error
; indicating this. This option will automatically retrieve your external IP
; address, even after it has changed in the case of dynamic IPs, and advertise
; it to the network using the ports the daemon is listening on. This does not
; support devices behind multiple NATs.
